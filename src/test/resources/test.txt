Lie down, fair one and come away
'Til the rain is over and gone
G-g-gimme the beat now (face the music)
Leadline
(Face the music)
If the air is a little thick in this room tonight
I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Overcome by this colorful sight
Talkin' so fast that even they
Talkin' so fast that even they don't know what they mean
Of all the things that base a rhyme
How is it that you every time
Regurgitate the racist lines that keep us apart?
Thank God this ain't Monopoly
You'd make us all go back to start
Race
In the space, I mark human (face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space, I mark human (face the music)
Cut me, cut you
Both the blood is red
I gotcha
Race
Race
Check it
Three seats over there's a lady black
Entrusted to her care is a little white girl
And the fact of the matter is
Before her momma or another kid at school
Tells her about the fallacy that one race rules over the other
She'd be a much-better-off-left, fool
(Face the music)
If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Then how my dear, tell me now how my dear
Tell me now how now would we know?
And then the band say
Race
In the space I mark human (face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (face the music)
Cut me, cut you
Both the blood is red
I gotcha
Race
Race
(Face the music)
D-d-down with H-I-S-T-O-R-Y and all this b.S propagandi
Keepin' you from me and me from you as we grow
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
Why those before us hated each other
I'd rather believe they never did
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
That there's hope for a kid
And if he imitates the best
I guess that's what I'll try to be
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea
Race
(Face face face face face)
Face the music (face the music)
Face the music
Race
In the space I mark human (face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (face the music)
Cut me, cut you
Both the blood is red
Get it?
Race
Got it
Race
Face the music
Race, race
(Face, face, face the music)
Race, race
(Face, face, face the music)
Race, race
Race, race
(Face-f-face the music)
Race
